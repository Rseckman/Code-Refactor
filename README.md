# Code-Refactor

For this assignment the objective was to take the existing HTML and CSS code and clean it up.  To make sure it was using current HTML 5 semantic elements, create a more consice css sheet, and ensure that the code follows accessibility standards so that the site is optomized for search engines.

As part of that task, I changed most all "div" tags to a HTML semantic element to help identify the structure of the code (except one).  I included alt attributes after each image to make the code more accessable.  I gave the site a title that matches what they are.  And I consolodated css code that was repetitive and made sure they aligned with the current semantic identifications.
